# {{PROBLEM}} Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

    As a user
    So that I can record my experiences
    I want to keep a regular diary

    As a user
    So that I can reflect on my experiences
    I want to read my past diary entries

    As a user
    So that I can reflect on my experiences in my busy day
    I want to select diary entries to read based on how much time I have and my reading speed

    As a user
    So that I can keep track of my tasks
    I want to keep a todo list along with my diary

    As a user
    So that I can keep track of my contacts
    I want to see a list of all of the mobile phone numbers in all my diary entries

## 2. Design the Class System


```

class Diary

  - add(entry)
  - all
  - sort_by_time_to_read(time)
    => Some entry or entries that can be read within time?


class DiaryEntry(title, contents)

  - initilize 
    @title
    @contents
    @mobile_number
    @total_words



```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```ruby
class MusicLibrary
  def initialize
    # ...
  end

  def add(track) # track is an instance of Track
    # Track gets added to the library
    # Returns nothing
  end

  def all
    # Returns a list of track objects
  end
  
  def search_by_title(keyword) # keyword is a string
    # Returns a list of tracks with titles that include the keyword
  end
end

class Track
  def initialize(title, artist) # title and artist are both strings
  end

  def format
    # Returns a string of the form "TITLE by ARTIST"
  end
end
```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# Gets all tracks
library = MusicLibrary.new
track_1 = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track_2 = Track.new("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
library.add(track_1)
library.add(track_2)
library.all # => [track_1, track_2]
```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# Constructs a track
track = Track.new("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
