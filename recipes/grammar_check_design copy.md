* As a user
* So that I can improve my grammar
* I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter and ends with a suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark.

```ruby

def grammar_check(string)  
  return #something 
end

```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

grammar_check("Hello my name is Marlon!") => "grammar police is happy"
